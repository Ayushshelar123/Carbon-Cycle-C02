        <h1>Detailed Carbon Cycle</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <!-- Box 1: Photosynthesis -->
            <div class="box">
                <h2>Photosynthesis</h2>
                <p>Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2), and water into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). This process is crucial because it removes CO2 from the atmosphere and converts it into organic compounds, which are used by plants as an energy source. It forms the foundation of the food chain and is responsible for sustaining life on Earth.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Plants act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 and releasing O2, which is essential for life.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Box 2: Respiration -->
            <div class="box">
                <h2>Respiration</h2>
                <p>Respiration is the opposite of photosynthesis. It is the process by which living organisms, including plants and animals, release energy from glucose. During respiration, oxygen is consumed, and carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. This process helps maintain a balance of CO2 in the air and is essential for the growth and energy production of living organisms.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Respiration contributes to the continuous cycle of carbon, releasing CO2 back into the atmosphere.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <!-- Box 3: Decomposition -->
            <div class="box">
                <h2>Decomposition</h2>
                <p>Decomposition is the process by which dead organisms and organic matter are broken down by decomposers like bacteria, fungi, and detritivores. When these organisms break down dead material, carbon is released back into the environment in the form of CO2. This process is essential for recycling nutrients in ecosystems and returning carbon to the soil and atmosphere.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Decomposers play a key role in releasing carbon from dead organisms and organic matter into the environment.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Box 4: Fossil Fuels -->
            <div class="box">
                <h2>Fossil Fuels</h2>
                <p>Over millions of years, the remains of plants and animals are buried and subjected to heat and pressure, eventually forming fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. When burned for energy, these fuels release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels is one of the primary contributors to increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, which is linked to global warming and climate change.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Fossil fuels contain stored carbon that, when burned, releases CO2, contributing to climate change.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <!-- Box 5: Ocean Uptake -->
            <div class="box">
                <h2>Ocean Uptake</h2>
                <p>The oceans play a crucial role in the carbon cycle. The surface waters of the ocean absorb large amounts of atmospheric CO2 through a process known as ocean uptake. Phytoplankton in the ocean also conduct photosynthesis, absorbing CO2 from the water and converting it into organic matter. Some of this carbon is then transferred to deeper ocean layers, where it can be stored for long periods.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Oceans act as a major carbon sink, absorbing a significant amount of atmospheric CO2.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Box 6: Carbon Sequestration -->
            <div class="box">
                <h2>Carbon Sequestration</h2>
                <p>Carbon sequestration is the process by which CO2 is captured and stored in natural systems like forests, soils, and oceans, or through artificial methods. Plants and trees absorb CO2 during photosynthesis and store it in their biomass. Carbon can also be stored in the soil through the decomposition of organic matter. This process helps mitigate the effects of excess carbon in the atmosphere.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Carbon sequestration is an important natural process that helps reduce atmospheric CO2 and combat climate change.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <!-- Box 7: Human Impact -->
            <div class="box">
                <h2>Human Impact</h2>
                <p>Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels for energy, transportation, and industrial processes, have significantly altered the natural carbon cycle. Deforestation, agriculture, and the release of greenhouse gases from industrial processes have increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and climate change. Efforts to reduce carbon emissions and enhance carbon sequestration are key to mitigating these impacts.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Human activities are disrupting the natural carbon cycle, leading to increased greenhouse gases and climate change.</p>
